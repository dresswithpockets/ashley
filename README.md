# ashley
A .NET Port of the [beloved ECS framework of the same name](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley).

Ashley does not have a dependency on libgdx or similar frameworks.

This port is intended to function nearly identically as the source material, with minor differences - in things like naming conventions.

### Report issues
Found unexpected behaviour, want to request a new feature, or found a disparity between this port and the source material? Check the existing issues to see if the same request or problem is already listed; otherwise, feel free to submit a new issue with your request or problem. Provide as much detail as you can.

### Contribute
Because this is intended to be a nearly 1-to-1 port of the original, existing features will largely remain unchanged.

However, if you would like to contribute with new features or bugfixes: fork this repo and send a pull request. Please make sure all of the [unit tests](https://github.com/phxvyper/ashley/tree/master/ashley.Tests) are passing before submitting your PR. Add new unit tests for new features, or to cover a new found bug.
